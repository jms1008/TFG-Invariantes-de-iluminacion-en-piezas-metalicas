%% Cache Memory
%% What is it?
% The cache memory in an application is a temporary data storage space that 
% improves performance by reducing information access times. Its main function 
% is to store data or results that are costly to obtain or calculate, so that 
% they can be reused in future operations quickly and efficiently.
%% Why use it?
% Since the execution of the algorithms, both illumination invariance and image 
% segmentation, has a high computational cost, it has been decided to use a cache 
% memory. This will temporarily store all executions, saving them with a descriptive 
% name so that if the user tries to execute the same algorithm, it will be stored 
% in the cache:
%% 
% # If the user tries to run the same illumination invariance algorithm on the 
% same image, it is not necessary to run the algorithm again.
% # If in addition the segmentation method is the same with the same number 
% of centers, it will also avoid recalculating the segmentation on both the original 
% and the invariant image.
%% 
% When closing the application, the cached data will be deleted. Only those 
% images that the user has saved using the “Save images” button will be kept in 
% memory since they are not saved in the cache memory.
